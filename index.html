         One of my fondest childhood memories is of the first time I played a video game. It was the year  2000 and I was 6 years old. My father brought me down to the basement where he had his original NES set up on our second TV. He booted up Super Mario Bros. and showed me the buttons. He showed me how to get the best height on the flag pole, how to do the level skip in World 1-2, and how the swimming worked in World 2-2. I was awful at the game, but I fantasized about it all day at school and drew Mario all over my notebooks. One day, I went to boot up the console and it would not turn on. My father tried everything but was unable to get it working. He threw out the console, controllers, and all of the games. I had no idea at the time, but this had had a profound effect on me.

            The same year as the death of my NES, I received a Gameboy Color and Pokemon Red for my birthday. In 2002, a neighbor gave me his old Super Nintendo with many games and extra controllers. Both of these consoles would break as well but I refused to give up the games and controllers when I surrendered them to the electronics recycling. My mother was not happy but relented and I stored my now useless cartridges somewhere in her basement. I would go on to have many more consoles and games as I grew, but luckily, I maintained them much better and, when they became outdated, into the storage they would go.

            I got my first job at the age of 18 in 2012. Upon receiving my first paycheck, my immediate thought was to put some money aside for a date with my girlfriend. My second thought was to visit our local mom-and-pop games store.

            I was looking for games for my PS3 when I spotted the “Retro Games” section. I felt nostalgic upon seeing Super Nintendo Cartridges and became frustrated when I remembered I no longer had mine. I asked the owner if they had any Super Nintendos and sure enough, they did. The top panel was very yellow but I was undeterred as that was pretty standard for the American SNES as the top of the console used a different, cheaper plastic that oxidized over time, causing bromine in the plastic to leak out and yellow the panel. I purchased the console for a price that would make game collectors of today cry and I took the console home.

            I spent the evening playing my childhood favorites which of course included Super Mario All Stars which contained the original NES game. This caused a revelation in me. I would purchase and preserve as many games and their consoles as possible so that I would never again lose access to these things which were important to me.It started with replacing games or consoles that I had lost and or had expired. It then grew beyond that scope into a general collection hobby. I had not grown up with a Sega Dreamcast or a Nintendo 64, but they were added to my collection and enjoyed just the same. After a while, my girlfriend (the same that I spent much of my first paycheck on) became a bit concerned with my spending and “suggested” that I focus more on saving and working towards my future. I luckily chose to listen to her and my collection was put on hold for some time.

            I added small items from time to time. Sometimes I would be gifted things, sometimes I saw something strange in a garage sale. I did not consider myself much of a collector anymore but I still maintained my collection and kept everything in working condition. Much of this changed with the birth of my daughter in September 2021. I was 27 and had married that same girlfriend from before in 2018. We welcomed our baby into the world and everything changed.

            In preparation for our daughter&apos;s arrival, much of my gaming archive was boxed up and the office it had been kept in became a nursery. Over time, even the parts that had been kept out for quick access were put behind child locked doors and largely forgotten about with the stress of huge new responsibilities. We saw an opportunity in 2023 to sell our home when the market was high and our funds were low. We moved back in with my parents as, with my father being disabled and our frequent need for childcare, it was advantageous to all parties. Shortly after settling in, I was taking an evening stroll when I saw our neighbors were throwing away a beautiful 32 inch CRT TV. I immediately seized upon this opportunity. During covid, the retro gaming market boomed and games, consoles, and CRT&apos;s skyrocketed in price. I knew a set like this was worth two to three hundred dollars at least.

            With great effort and the assistance of a wagon, ramp, a dolly, and much cardboard and tape, I was able to get the 115 pound set home and into my parents basement. I cleaned it up, purchased its original remote online and opened it up to do some light maintenance on the image. After digging out an old console and reliving a part of my childhood once more, I knew I had a new plan for my collection.

            I decided I wanted each of my older consoles to be playable on this screen the way they were originally intended. Not only do retro games feel more authentic on a CRT, they also look better as the lines between the “pixels” allows gaps to be filled that are not on a modern LCD

            I also wanted them to be the highest fidelity possible. Luckily, my set was a JVC D-Series which has both S-Video and Component options. These are vastly superior to a RF or Composite image and makes the consoles look much better than they did in my youth.

            Finally, I wanted my collection to take up less space and as such, I would rip each disc and cartridge to be playable from the consoles storage or from a modern flash cartridge which emulates a standard cartridge but can be loaded with multiple roms that can be chosen from as desired. It should also be stated that this process uses all of my own purchased equipment and games and is completely legal.

            While this process is not fully complete as I still need to compress some games, modify some consoles, or purchase certain accessories to make every game playable, it has been a fun and often rewarding task. Learning how to modify hardware and software gives me many of the same “AHA!” moments that I get from learning to code. Above all, it has been worth it to preserve something from my childhood for my daughter. I look forward to a year or so from now when I can show her my collection and have her experience something that meant so much to me when I was her age. Either way, I hope she&apos;ll at least remember the time we spent together. Who knows? Maybe someday she&apos;ll want to relive a part of that experience with her own child.
